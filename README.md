# pythonforteachers.github.io

This is the GitHub repository hosting the content for pythonforteachers.github.io. 

Feel free to make suggestions for content by e-mail at ryan.pepper@soton.ac.uk or
in the 'Issues' page. Please discuss before making a pull request, as I'd like to 
keep the level of this site relatively low - I'd like to mainly aim it at people 
such as ICT teachers in the UK with little or no programming experience who need 
some help!
